# B1Profile
Borderlands Enhanced profile.bin editor

In this repository you will find:

* a B1Profile.dll library that provides an interface to parse a profile.bin, change values in it, and save it again
* a B1ProfileCMD program that uses this library for some examples and proof of concept
* a B1ProfileGUI that prorvides a graphic interface to edit the one value one usually wants to change - Golden Keys.

Partially reverse engineered from the previous Borderlands 2 Profile Editor by Philymaster.

Also check out [B2Profile](https://github.com/withmorten/B2Profile/), which uses the same file format.
